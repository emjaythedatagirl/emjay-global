# *Global Terrorism Project*

## Project Overview:

This project analyzes terrorism incidents globally using a massive dataset from Kaggle.com called the Global Terrorism Database (GTD). The Global Terrorism Dataset contains information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 to 2017 and is currently the most comprehensive unclassified database on terrorist attacks around the world. The data includes systematic information on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time, which includes more than 180,000 attacks. 

## Data Sources:

The dataset was a CSV file downloaded from Kaggle.com, named ‘Global Terrorism Data’ from 1970-2017. The data set contains:
1.	Year: This field contains the year in which the incident occurred
2.	Country: This field identifies the country or location where the incident occurred.
3.	Region: This field identifies the region in which the incident occurred.
4.	Attack type: The general method of attack and broad class of tactics used.
